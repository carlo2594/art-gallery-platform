          p.about-text.mb-4 Galería del Ox was born as a family project, simple and full of soul. It all started by painting together, without expectations, just with the desire to share art at home.
          p.about-text.mb-4 That intimate space was transformed into a growth workshop. We learned to listen to each other, to express ourselves freely and to inspire each other.
          p.about-text.mb-0 Galería del Ox is a reflection of our origin: a place where art is experienced as a family and shared from the soul.
